# `nanorc` files for macOS
As of macOS 12.3, the old version of `nano` (v2.0.6 last time I checked) has been replaced with `pico` (v5.09).

`pico` does not do syntax highlighting, so it is not useful for me.

You can compile/install GNU `nano` pretty easily.  ([Instructions are posted on my site.](https://phasefactor.dev))

These files are not useful for modern `nano`. If you compile/install it, then you should just use the syntax highlighting examples provided in the GNU distro.

I will leave these up.
