# nanorc files
Optional files for the OS X distro of nano (v2.0.6 at the time I made these) to make it a functional development tool.

To use:
- grab the files, 
- put the (language name).nanorc files into a directory of your choice, 
- drop the nanorc file into your home directory (~) and rename it to .nanorc

If you did not use the same path for the language specific .nanorc files the main nanorc file will need to be updated with the correct path.
