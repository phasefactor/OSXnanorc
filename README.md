# `nanorc` files for macOS
As of macOS 12.3, `nano` (v2.0.6 last time I checked) has been replaced with `pico` (v5.09).

`pico` does not do syntax highlighting, so it is not useful for me.

You can compile/install GNU `nano` pretty easily.  ([Instructions are posted on my site.](https://phasefactor.dev))

These files are not useful for modern `nano`, and you should just use the syntax highlighting examples provided in the GNU distro...
