# `nanorc` files for macOS
As of macOS 12.3, the old version of `nano` (v2.0.6 the last time I checked) has been replaced with `pico` (v5.09).

`pico` does not do syntax highlighting, so these are no longer very useful.

You can compile/install GNU `nano` pretty easily.  However, these files are not very useful for modern `nano`. 

If you do compile/install it, then you should just use the syntax highlighting examples provided in the GNU distro.

I will leave this repo up for anyone who might find it useful.
